Congratulations on completing the course! To get an idea of your skill level, please refer to the following chart:

Points: 0 - 75
Skill Level: Beginner
Description: If your score falls in this range, that means you still have a lot of work to do. If you scored at least 30, that could mean you know what loops, functions, integers, and other elements of the language are, but you need to practice them to be able to use them comfortably. If you scored near 75, that could mean you can create simple Python programs, but you've to work some more to understand and solve more complex issues. 



Points: 76 - 150
Level: Intermediate
Description: Python basics are not a problem for you, and you are on the right track to becoming an advanced programmer. You can understand and solve complex problems but still have some gaps with some aspects of Python. In case you scored near 150, you can probably get an entry-level Python programming job.



Points: 151 - 224
Level: Advanced
Description: If your score falls in this range, that means you can program independently and solve complex Python problems. It also means you can get a job as a Python programmer with not much effort. Congratulations!
